## Work Experience
**Customer Success Manager @ Lifemote Networks (_May 2022 - August 2023_)**
- Supervised ISPs within the UK and Greenland.
- Engineered a Data Science and Analytics algorithm to track ISPs’ mesh upgrade success rates, reducing unnecessary truck-roll and mesh upgrade costs by 26%.
- Trained end-users and facilitated the onboarding of new customers.

**Data Science Intern @ n11.com (_June 2021 - July 2021_)**
- Programmed a Machine Learning algorithm that predicts the probability of churn of customers with 76% accuracy using their purchase data.

## Projects
### Detection of Dengue Fever Cases Using Machine Learning
- Forecasted Dengue cases for 2 cities using 3 different ML models.
- Achieved a 4% improvement over the current #1 solution on DrivenData ( out of 5600+ competitors).

Conducted a comprehensive study where I compared the effectiveness of 3 AI models in predicting weekly Dengue Fever cases in the cities of San Juan, Puerto Rico and Iquitos, Peru. The 3 models used were Support Vector Machines, Random Forest and Lasso Regression. This project was done for my Data Science with Machine Learning module during my Master's. The accompanying .pdf file is our full report that explains the scientific logic behind our results.

### Election Result Prediction Using Twitter Sentiment Analysis

Conducted a comprehensive study where the 2020 US Presidential Election results were correctly predicted using the sentiments from 2 million tweets tweeted around the time of the election. The main assumption was that we would calculate positive tweets / all tweets per candidate. Between Donald Trump and Joe Biden, whoever had a higher ratio would have to have been the winner. This assumption turned out to be true as Joe Biden had a higher ratio.

Another goal was to create a novel approach and compare it to the state-of-the-art, while proving the novel approach to be scalable and fault-tolerant, which it was.

### UK Traffic Police Web App

Developed a web application for the UK traffic police to record traffic incidents, add or search licence plate numbers and add and search driver licence numbers. The app includes an admin feature that can create or delete users, along with an audit trail so that the actions taken can be monitored in the future.

### Smart Home Security System

Created a smart home security system prototype using Arduino Uno with a flame sensor, Passive Infrared (PIR) sensor and a sound sensor to detect a fire and burglary, which sends notifications in these events over Wi-Fi.
